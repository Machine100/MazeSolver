Maze Solver

Live at endpoint: http://algorithmvisualizer.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

Generate a maze and then find the shortest path solution using the breadth-first algorithm.

Does have a bug in it atm that will crash the browser: just press the buttons too fast. But it makes pretty colors and is fun. May fix the crashing part soon. But we'll call the colors a feature.

Implemented using Typescript in the Angular framework.
